(1) Look, a beggar stands still,
With pitiful eyes, he looks up.
A silent light of deep sorrow,
A thin thread of hope he plays,
Near the sunlit courtyard.
In a single point, he dissolves,
The entire history of his life.

(2) Look, look at those tattered clothes!
Oh, time, how cruel you are!
Thoughts like stones on the path of life!
Shivering and trembling he stands.
The beggar extends his begging bowl, alas!
With taxes, he's unstable, filled with fear.

(3) Look at the dust of years,
Fallen upon his head.
Look at the streams of tears,
Etched upon his face,
Day after day, upon his chest,
Wounds are carved deep.

(4) Slowly, slowly, he drags himself,
Silent cries fill the air around,
With a heart breaking from agony,
Leaning on his worn-out stick,
He utters in a voice that tears through his chest,
""A handful of rice.""
A lifetime's plea,
""A handful of rice.""

(5) Among humans, this is the cry,
From the depths of a human heart.
From brothers, this plea for alms,
A handful of rice he seeks.
In the sunlit courtyard, this,
A dark observation.
Amidst the laughter of flowers, this,
A sorrowful lamentation.

(6) Who could he be, whose son?
Whose father, so poor?
Which mother, while holding him dear,
Lit the two lamps of his eyes?
What hope opened his eyes,
Near the gaze of the sun and moon?
Why did they close? Why did he lose his mind?
Why did this sweet life's lamp dim?

(7) Before the eyes of Lord Buddha,
This beggar came,
In this form, in these words,
The pain in his heart cried out.
The vast ocean of great compassion,
In these very words, it surged.
Disguise aside, the pride of sacrifice,
Turned cruel and heartless.

(8) Fallen from dark clouds,
Lost in the darkness,
Is it God or a beggar?
God speaks, having entered the heart,
Searching every house and courtyard.
He speaks in a voice of pain,
With a heart heavy with compassion.
An ocean of tears from ages past,
He pours out.
In the depths of sorrow, God speaks,
Opening the abyss below.
He begs for compassion from his brothers,
""Oh, people of the earth!""
God begs for alms,
""A beggar in my own courtyard?""

बादल,"```
We are the offspring of the vast waters,
Born of the summer's heat,
Ours was a festive birth,
All bright and clean,
The sun and waves laughed,
Dancing with glee,
The winds were invited from afar,
Blowing with great vigor.

We yearned to soar the skies,
Our aspirations high,
Slowly we climbed the clean rays,
Like tiny threads of light.
Higher and higher we climbed, met, and spread,
Into the realm of the sky,
The wind carries us to wander the world,
Islands, cities, and jungles.

We see the divine exhibition of the Earth,
Of plains and fields,
Of valleys, caves, mountains, and forests,
Of rivers and gardens.

Streams of crystal-clear water,
Cascading waterfalls, groves of trees,
From humble huts to grand mansions,
Palaces, and avenues.

तिनको घँसिया गीत,"```
1. On the velvet-soft, grassy, green roof
Of the mountain's lush and beautiful lap,
Chirping, chirping, countless birds sing.
The sky, a canvas of pristine, deep blue,
With fluffy, cotton-like clouds,
Westward, a crimson glow, eastward, a net,
A painter's masterpiece.
A lone maiden, eyes bright,
Body radiant, cheeks rosy,
A light, delicate, heart-stealing melody,
Charming, graceful, and lovely.
In the open, bright expanse of solitude,
Her youthful laughter blooms freely,
A full moon in its artistic glory.
Sparkling dewdrops playfully dance,
A charming smile graces her lips,
In the beautiful water, on the cool ground,
She sings her melodious song.

2. The water's murmur, the sun's descent,
Clouds shimmer, leaves sway gently,
Tender hands gather fresh, red berries.
The young maiden, like a flowing river,
Cuts through, her emotions resonating.
Fragrant crops fill the essence within,
While somewhere far, a distant flute
Plays its youthful tune.
A gentle tremor arises, enchanting,
As flower buds open their lips,
Blending with the water, merging with the heart,
Soon to unite within the clouds.
The heart beats in sync, the world a melody,
In the beautiful water, on the cool ground,
She sings her melodious song.

3. Memories resurface,
As all those melodies intertwine,
Time flows in reverse,
Birdsong echoes in my ears.
Nature adorns the same hues,
The maiden sits, cutting grass,
A red rhododendron blooms in her hair,
Youth's sweet reflection in the water,
Seems boundless, like a distant shore.
I fade away, like a speck of dust,
At the beautiful gate of infinity.
My heart trembles, touched by nature,
A lotus bud of beauty,
A song of longing takes flight,
To reach the bright city of light.
Time speaks in enchanting words,
As the grass is cut with a swish,
In the beautiful water, on the cool ground,
That melodious song arises once more.

सन्ध्या,"```
Lalitpur's high-art craftsmanship, what a wonder the chisel has wrought!
With balanced, delicate lines, what patterns have been etched, look!
Upon the vapor-smooth marble, red!
In the Vasant Mahal, a window to the ancient West!
Atop Chandragiri, vast!
Did it drink water? It gleams with gold!
Well-prepared, it stands!

I am a traveler of the sunset!
On the wings of imagination, a sweet murmur!
What turmoil in my emotions!
The road of time is long!
Ages are alleys, alleys!
My soul, a spectator,
Seeks beauty, alley by alley!

Behind the window's patterns, whose exquisite face is that?
Whose sweet fragments of vision, savoring, savoring,
The flickering lights, my heart, amazed by imagination, is truly luxurious!
Older than memory, who are those queens of beauty?
Royal maids of a bygone era?
Burning bright, solitary?
Immortal? Thirsty for love?
Etched in the bars, are they in heaven's court?
In Vasant's inner chambers today,
In Shringar?

Are they eager to apply kohl, to adorn themselves in long, flowing garments?
Or is it the dream of their own heart,
Love-struck?
Krishna-like, with hair like flowing clouds?
To captivate? To fill with jewels?
To steal hearts? To conquer?
The Simrik bird's spring-sun-like, bright tika,
Firmly placed on the forehead!
You wiped it with a little water, that smudge! On this window!
In front of the mirror, bend down, stand tall!
Test your conquering power with a sly glance!
Be joyful, a little playful, with a blush blooming!
Erase a little, add a little!
Imagine a little more!
The soul of music flows,
Half-shy! Hum softly,
Oh beautiful one!

This fog, woven by the Himalayas' breath,
Thin, shimmering, and fleeting,
Lift the starry curtain a little! Cast a swift wind upon it!
Your hair is dark!
Is there a message to be delivered,
To the depths of Amravati's spring?
From your beloved King Chandra?
Climbing these Himalayan, forest-filled, thief-ridden paths,
This Arundhati of the wilderness!
Oh ancient muse!
Whose memory's red rendezvous makes you fall in love!
That immortal, eternally youthful, and glorious one!
To that indescribable connoisseur,
My salutations, oh king!

सम्झना,"```
When clouds gather in the sky,
Sadness descends upon life's tapestry.
When tears cascade like pouring rain,
A barren wasteland blossoms within the heart.

When logic crumbles into lamentations,
Painful memories resurface in the mind.
Like dreams of a city after an earthquake,
Remember the night of the new moon.

Cries echo in the desert,
Hands reach for the forehead in despair.
Life, a curse to endure,
A blade poised for a final act.

I curse this cruel world, a jungle,
A cry lost within its depths.
When the will to live fades,
Despair engulfs the heart.

Then I realize, holding back my tears,
That you are the poison and the cure.
In my memories, a garden blooms,
Filled with colors and sweet nectar.

Rise again, my weary soul,
Bathe in the cool waters of resilience.
Let the nightingale sing in your heart,
Bringing forth a gentle spring.

Your breath, a fragrant breeze,
Carries the scent of Malayan winds.
In the depths of my memories,
Your sweet melodies awaken.

Which temple do you go to, O traveler, which temple do you seek?
What offerings do you carry, and how do you plan to proceed?
On whose shoulders do you ride, to which divine city do you wish to reach?

With bones as beautiful pillars, and flesh as walls so wide,
This golden roof of the mind, and senses as doors inside,
Nerves like rivers flowing, a temple vast and grand,
Which temple do you go to, O traveler, at which door do you stand?

On the beautiful throne of the mind, reigns the Lord of the Universe,
This radiant jewel of consciousness, His crown, a divine verse.
This beautiful temple of the body, in the center of all creation,
God resides within, yet you search outside, what a strange situation!

God dwells in the depths, while you wander on the surface so far,
You search for Him everywhere, but have you looked within, by far?
Cultivate your heart, let the light within you brightly blaze,
O fellow traveler! God walks beside you, in a myriad of ways.

God kisses the hands that work, with a touch so pure and bright,
He caresses with His magical hands, His devotees with all His might.
God sings by the roadside, in the melody of the birds so sweet,
He speaks in the pain and sorrow, of the people He longs to meet.

But He never gives darshan, to the eyes and ears of the skin,
Which temple do you go to, O traveler, in this foreign land within?
Come, let us go together, and join hands with all mankind,
Let us heal the wounds of the suffering, with compassion we shall find.

Let us become the divine face of God, and smile upon this land,
For in serving humanity, true divinity we shall command.

Thought! Enter sharp, fill the heart with light,
In the dark of night, spread your rays, oh beautiful.
Like the sunrise, a sweet sight to show,
Awaken a thousand gentle words of love.

Rise gently, like the cool morning breeze,
With good wishes, dear fragrance, delightful.
Let imagination fly, a divine swan in the eastern sky,
Where, in the enchanting dawn, lies the joy of truth and beauty.

Like the pure dewdrops on the jasmine flower,
May your heart be open, a canvas for emotions to flow.
Shine like gold, ignite the clouds with your passion,
Unspoken, delicate, like a tender, small thought.

Bloom, sweet flowers, in the garden of the heart,
A joy to behold, though nameless and unique.
Sway gently, young leaves, like children of beauty,
I see your vibrant colors, wandering in the garden of my heart.

May all my desires find fulfillment in your beauty,
My meditation, like a devotee's, finds its grand temple in nature.
On the shimmering shoulders of the dawn-lit Himalayas,
I seek the familiar paths within my heart, to wander in my own home.

1 A tree stands tall before me, its spread is wide and dense,
Its cool leaves whisper softly, a haven of peace intense.
My heart soars with emotions, as colors dance in the breeze,
Its roots spread deep within my soul, branches adorned with flowers at ease.

2 Oh tree, I share my secrets, with you, my friend so old,
Sweet solace in your presence, even when alone, I'm bold.
In silence, we converse, our bond transcends mere words,
Unspoken tales we share, like secrets whispered by birds.

3 You have life, desires, a heart that beats within,
Your life unfolds in colors, mirroring my own skin.
The earth dances through seasons, curtains rise and fall,
Sun and shade play upon you, winds whisper and enthrall.

4 From afar, cuckoos arrive, their melodies so sweet,
They build their nests upon your boughs, while other birds discreet,
Bring tidings from distant lands, a symphony so grand,
Awakening within us, emotions we understand.

5 Your roots delve deep in the earth, drawing sustenance unseen,
You grow, you bloom, your flowers bright, a reflection of our dreams.
Our roots too lie within the earth, we strive for heights above,
Within us lies the beauty, the joy of spring's gentle love.

6 Hues of dawn and twilight, the moon's soft, silvery glow,
Rain's gentle touch, wind's playful dance, stars twinkling above,
The purity of water, the warmth of the sun's embrace,
All blend and bloom in vibrant hues, emotions we retrace.

7 Your leaves, like thoughts, abound and sway, they fall and rise anew,
Taking shape and form again, mirroring what we go through.
They dance with life, in rhythm with the breath of the sky,
Like waves unseen, our lives too flow, beneath a watchful eye.

8 You have your place, your purpose, your striving to fulfill,
To spread, to bloom, to wither, a cycle of nature's will.
Your form, your essence, your beauty, unique in every way,
Your space, your role, your own to claim, in life's grand display.

9 A seed you were, a tree you became, your form yet to unfold,
A million leaves, a tapestry of beauty, within you they were told.
You spread your branches, a verdant hue, your colors bright and bold,
Today's reality, tomorrow's dream, a story yet untold.

10 New seeds will sprout, new trees will rise, whispering in the breeze,
New birds will sing, their melodies, carried on the seas.
This earth, the moon, the sun above, will dance in rhythmic sway,
To bloom, to fade, a cycle of life, where beauty holds its sway.

गरीब,"`Do you call me poor? I am as rich as happiness,
You won't find such wealth anywhere in the world.
I am not a slave to the desires of luxury,
My sweet labor is my delicious reward.

Like a river on the stone of effort,
I flow, laughing, filled with waves.
I don't stagnate in one place like a pond,
Every particle of this life is pure.

My forehead is adorned with sweat,
Those pearls are invaluable.
There's a beautiful lamp of peace within,
And the taste of nectar in every bite.

Hunger is sweet, thirst is delicious,
And finally, the aroma of satisfaction.
With a few needs met,
I create new worlds to inhabit.

The universe is my beautiful home,
The blue sky, a magnificent roof.
It's filled with countless gems,
The moon, the stars, and the radiant sun.

Dawn and dusk paint the sky with colors,
Clouds arrive and marvel at the sight.
The dance of seasons is a beautiful spectacle,
A play of light and shadow, day and night.

Flowers sway and dangle like fairies,
Sparkling with beautiful beads of dew.
Birds sing a thousand melodious tunes,
A symphony of nature's instruments.

The velvety grass, so soft and inviting,
Where I rest after my hard work.
The mighty trees, my wings,
As the wind blows through them, free and strong.

A small hut, my abode of joy,
Reached after climbing the mountain of ambition.
The wind plays freely above,
The endless blue sky overhead.

Alone, simple, and amidst infinity,
Near a cascading waterfall.
Stars twinkle above,
And the moon rises with a smile.

The evening adorns this beautiful scene,
The mountains and fields, a breathtaking view.
I bask in the joy of the sun,
And find peace in the embrace of darkness.

Taking my heart on a flight of fancy,
I wander through the moon, stars, and earth.
Enjoying the thrill of this journey,
I return to my lovely abode.

With a cheerful and carefree youth,
I open my heart to the world, embracing life's drops.
Adorned with ornaments that shimmer,
Roses sway as if intoxicated by joy.

My garden is filled with fairies,
Sweet roses, and countless other flowers.
Fragrant and beautiful garments,
Colorful and vibrant, adorn the scene.

Sleep ushers in a unique beauty,
Her dreams, a sweet magic.
I forget the world in her embrace,
As dawn arrives, shy and charming.

God is with me day and night,
There's no fear, no worry here.
This world is so delightful,
Blessed am I to be a part of it.`

वसन्त,"```
What season has arrived, O Earth-queen, moon-mad!
Bees hum, birds flit and dart!
Nerves tremble, and the heart flutters!
Like the first lamps that flickered in the primal glimmer of creation,
In the first ripple of existence!

The time when Shiva unveils his cosmic dance!
When the Himalayas blush with Gauri's crimson hue!
At the first glimpse of Urvashi, my heart leaps like Vikrama's,
A wound where the sun has touched, look,
The tip of the evening star!

The sage's soul dances like a butterfly,
Liberated, calling this earth,
Heaven itself!
A nectar-filled paradise!

The stones seem to whisper,
Sharing secrets,
The saffron love of the universe!
We, the buds on swaying branches,
Have entered the white gates,
Sharing tales of blossoming with the world,
Sitting beside the fairies.

What fragrance do the waves carry,
Wave after wave!
The bud of my heart blooms,
Spreading its scent like a bee!

`In the awakening cries, a tender, sweet dawn's enchantment.
In the bamboo-spring's playful journey, a dream-flower's resonance.`

`Love's innocence, a moonlit magic,
Intoxication's haze, a sparkle in the eyes.
In beauty's embrace, a vast, luxurious bliss,
In gentle tremors, life's dance.`

`New reflections, foreign lands,
Aspirations take flight, soaring high.
Novel hues and waves,
A light song from innocent lips.`

`In the field of action, a youthful zeal,
Exploring and weighing new possibilities.
Relying on the strength of both love and courage,
A vast world, free and invaluable.`

`Colors fade into bitterness, illusions shattered,
Hopes stolen like scattered ashes.
Anxiety, sorrow, separation increase,
Unrelenting logic weighs heavy on the mind.`

`Creation's web, luxurious and grand,
Yet within, a self-inflicted defeat.
Winter's frost upon a blossoming head,
A stark contrast to the world's bustling affairs.`

`Growing awareness of solitude,
Forgotten dreams, once cherished and bright.
No shelter from the downpour of despair,
Sorrow, grief, and unfamiliar voices echo.`

`At the end of life's rosary,
Love's tremor, a vibration deep within.
Tear-filled eyes gently close,
Oh life, how strange and wondrous you are.`

अन्त्यमा,"```
Twinkling star, twinkling star, that distant light of my home,
May no dark clouds gather near, as life's sun starts to roam.

Remain serene, remain serene, the day's end, a bright sky's grace,
Let no gust, no restless wind, disturb this tranquil space.

The final hour of the evening, let it chime a gentle call,
As day's eyelids softly close, and darkness drapes us all.

This beautiful, divine expanse, a last glimpse to behold,
A final scene of fading light, as eyes begin to fold.

In the infinite sky above, a bird soars in peaceful flight,
Leaving the courtyard, seeking peace, in the woods, lost to the night.

A single word, a melody, a thread of joy unknown,
May it echo in the garden of a heart, as a memory sown.
``` 
"
जिन्दगीको मौसम,"```
May the season of life remain, keep plowing the field of your heart, let it not lay barren
As the rain pours, the water of consciousness, pure and white,
From the infinite ocean, the season arrives, circling round and round.
The soil of the heart blooms profusely, as the rain sings its song.
Tie the senses, the oxen of your body, to the plow, and keep tilling the field.
The seeds of karma are in the world, plant thousands, let them sprout in the field.
As long as the season of life remains, keep plowing, keep planting.
Don't let the cruel time make anyone barren, don't fall asleep just yet.
Plant all the seeds now; the grains will ripen later.
Don't cry later when the harsh winter comes for you.

झरना,"```
From the mountain's peak I saw,
Water cascading, a wondrous draw.
A thousand lamps ignited bright,
Within my heart, dispelling night.

Hidden power, a secret force,
Lies in the waterfall's vibrant source.
If only we could truly see,
The radiant light, electricity.

But alas, in vain it flows,
Wasted water, nobody knows.
Don't our hearts, like mountains high,
Hold springs of pure water, nigh?

If only within us, they could reside,
A thousand beautiful fountains, side by side.
Oh, the sorrow, the deep despair,
Darkness lingers, a heavy snare!
```"
घाँसी,"```A handsome youth slept soundly,
His pillow, a stone beneath a tree so profound.
A grasscutter sharpened his blade with care,
Sitting beside, lost in his own affair.

The forest's sweet melody did creep,
Into the youth's slumber, soft and deep.
One's heart soared high, in a blissful dream,
While the other's life, in waking, did gleam.

Awakening, the youth, with eyes so bright,
Asked the grasscutter, ""What do you do, with all your might?""
""I sharpen sickles,"" the man replied with a gentle smile,
""For those who toil, for a little while.""

""What kind of sickles?"" the youth inquired with grace,
""For those who journey, in this lonely space.
I have none to reflect in my heart's embrace,
My hands are weary, my sickle, a disgrace.""

""I sell them, to gather a few coins with care,
To buy a clay lamp, a wish I can't bear.
How can flowers bloom, if not sown with love?
How long can one play, with toys from above?""

Click, clack, the sickle danced with glee,
The grasscutter spoke, intermittently.
Each moment precious, like a shining gem,
He gathered them all, without a condemn.

""God's jungle, my field, where grass grows tall,
I harvest the bounty, for Tulsi's call.
I pay my dues, to this Earth so grand,
Rama's grace shines, for two days in this land.""

The youth was mesmerized, a magnetic spark,
As if lightning struck, leaving its mark.
The rustling leaves, a sweet melody,
Birdsong filled the forest, wild and free.

Emotions flowed, in rhythmic sway,
The youth's heart danced, along the way.
""Ah,"" he sighed, with a voice so serene,
""This grasscutter's life, a sight to be seen.""

""Awaken, awaken,"" the forest did call,
To the slumbering soul, standing tall.
The youth's eyes welled up, with tears so bright,
His chest swelled with joy, a beautiful sight.

Two teardrops fell, on the tranquil stone,
Forming beautiful lines, like words unknown.
Two letters emerged, ""Ra"" and ""Ma"" so clear,
A divine inscription, dispelling all fear.

""Who is there? Who is there?"" a voice so sweet,
As the sun dipped low, in its golden retreat.
More teardrops fell, from a heart so pure,
Pitter-patter, on the stone, they did endure.

The forest's colors, turned into ink,
Flowing like a river, on the brink.
Birds sang sweetly, in cages and trees,
A symphony of nature, carried by the breeze.

Drinking the nectar, the hills came alive,
With joy and laughter, they began to thrive.
Cool streams flowed, under shady trees,
Thirst and sorrow, vanished with the breeze.

They sang of Rama and Sita, with love so true,
The grasscutter joined, his heart anew.
Like a blooming lotus, his spirit did soar,
Two Nepali souls, united forevermore.

Oh, Venus star! Our beautiful guide,
Nepali, the first sound, we can't hide.
May our land be filled, with souls so bright,
Like this grasscutter, shining his light.

The beauty of our language, so pure and true,
Like a parrot's voice, sweet and new.
The innocence of childhood, in every line,
Simple, bright, and divine.

You have spoken, from the depths of your heart,
A sweetness that words, can't impart.
Return again, to this land of ours,
Where beauty awaits, in all its powers.

The birth of our language, a moment to behold,
A history so pure, a story to be told.
Oh, how bright is our Earth, how sweet the air,
A honeymoon of joy, beyond compare.
```"
सुनको बिहान,"```
A golden day will dawn, they say,
This land will open up its way.
Colorful clouds will spread above,
The waterfall will sing with love!

The birds awake and chirp with glee,
Temple bells ring out merrily.
The gentle breeze will softly blow,
And wake the sleeping flowers below.

The world will dance in vibrant hues,
The towering Himalayas, grand views.
Cool, refreshing dew will fall,
Progress will uplift us all!
```"
पाप लाग्छ,"```
Do not pluck, look, the bud!
Sin incurs, if you dare to thud.
Do not tear the flower, my child!
Mercy and religion get exiled.

Do not touch the birds, my dear,
Their tears, a curse, you'll bear.
Do not kill any creature you meet,
Death awakens, taking a seat.

Do not inflict wounds or pain,
It burns the heart, leaving a stain.
Do not blow dust, little one,
It flies and covers everyone.

Do not play in the dirt and grime,
Bad stains will mark you, time to time.
Do not cause any heart to ache,
Tears will flow, for goodness' sake.

Become like a flower, always bright,
Smile and spread your fragrant light.
Always bring joy to the world so wide,
Give hope eternal, with every stride.

Everywhere God resides, lend your ear,
Listen to this thought, hold it dear.
Do not hide or conceal,
Let no ill-feeling ever steal.
``` 
"
पैसा,"```
Oh, money, so bright and valuable,
To those with eyes, you light up the world.
Round and priceless, a captivating charm,
To possess you makes the mind soar.

The world is round, wealth too is round,
Money reigns supreme in all things.
With money, the heart blooms with joy,
It's the cure for all ailments and woes.

Money is everything, here and beyond,
With it, the world is rarely dark.
Money is power, wealth, strength, and life,
With it, one commands respect and honor.

The world bows to those with riches,
But turns away when one is penniless.
People become like dogs, devoid of humanity,
While money stands tall, a treasure in the world.

Money teaches cunning and deceit,
It absolves guilt and covers up wrongs.
With money, sorrows vanish without a trace,
No evil seems to exist in the world.

Yet, it's a seed of sin, dark and vile,
It wields knives, swords, and spears.
It ignites greed within the heart's chamber,
Leading to misery and a life of despair.

For money, people kill and betray,
All principles and morals are cast aside.
Used for good, it paves the path to heaven,
But for evil, it leads to countless miseries.

Therefore, amass wealth with a kind heart,
Let it be a source of joy, not sorrow's well.
Share your riches to wipe away tears,
And perform good deeds, big or small.

Consider this wealth your rightful inheritance,
My dear child, this is my plea and advice,
Always use it for righteousness and virtue.
```
"
सिँह र मुसा,"`It was a hot summer day, the sun was scorching hot,
The sky was ablaze, the heat was unbearable.
Seeking respite from the oppressive heat, I lay down
Under the shade of a tree, my tongue parched and dry.

There was a large lion, the king of all beasts,
With his eyes half-closed, he rested peacefully.
The shade of the tree provided a cool haven,
Where birds chirped and sang, offering a sense of tranquility.

The lion, lost in blissful slumber, enjoyed the peace,
While a tiny mouse scurried and frolicked below.
Unaware of the sleeping king, it ran around,
Its tiny paws making soft, rustling sounds.

The mouse, in its playful antics, climbed onto the lion,
Dancing and leaping without a care in the world.
Some of its companions nibbled at the lion's mane,
While others tickled him with their long tails.

The lion, annoyed by the disturbance, let out a roar,
His mighty paws swatting at the pesky creatures.
The mice scattered in fear, their tiny hearts pounding,
As the lion's anger shook the very ground.

The lion, unable to sleep, grew increasingly frustrated,
The constant buzzing and scurrying driving him mad.
""How dare these insignificant creatures disturb my rest?"" he thought,
His royal pride wounded by their audacity.

Determined to teach them a lesson, he caught one of the mice,
Its tiny body trembling in his grasp.
""Spare me, your majesty!"" pleaded the terrified mouse,
""I meant no harm, I was only playing.""

The lion, amused by the mouse's pleas, decided to let it go,
""Go on then,"" he chuckled, ""but don't let me catch you again.""
The mouse, grateful for its life, scurried away,
Vowing to repay the lion's kindness someday.

Fate, as it often does, took an unexpected turn,
And the mighty lion found himself caught in a hunter's trap.
He roared and struggled, but his strength was no match for the ropes,
His pride and power rendered useless.

The little mouse, hearing the lion's desperate cries,
Rushed to his aid, its tiny teeth gnawing at the ropes.
Strand by strand, it worked tirelessly,
Until finally, the lion was free.

The lion, humbled by the experience, thanked the mouse,
Realizing that even the smallest creature can show great kindness.
""I misjudged you,"" he admitted, ""You have saved my life.""
And so, the lion and the mouse became unlikely friends,
A testament to the power of compassion and forgiveness.`

मास्टरजी,"```A small chin, with a beard just beginning to sprout,
Black stubble that's rubbed repeatedly with two fingers.
In his right hand, a long, thin cane,
Or a slender stick that can deliver a thousand whacks.

Eyes, oh eyes, distorted by countless black letters,
Two round spectacles through which he sees the world.
Three thousand times, under the scorching sun,
Our dark-skinned master teaches, a walking encyclopedia.

His thin tongue flickers like a red lizard,
His gait swift, he carries a load of books,
Collecting thoughts and ideas from their pages.
Saturdays and Tuesdays seem endless, Bhim and Bhrikuti appear menacing,
He's the bane of boys who don't memorize their lessons.

His stomach, like a sarangi, hollow and thin,
A wonder to behold, how can this be?
Yet, within it, a mountain range of books,
So much knowledge crammed into such a small space.

His tiny head carries the weight of the world,
His small mouth utters words a thousand hands long.
There's nothing he doesn't know, his mind a globe,
He can effortlessly name cities, Paris, London, every town.

But ask him about Sanskrit, and he'll simply say,
""Oh, please, don't bother me with that.""
And while he teaches, his head spins like a top,
A curious contradiction, this learned soul.

पल्टन,"```The drums of war thunder, a call to arms so clear!
For our beloved nation, we march forth without fear!
Take up your weapons, sons of the soil so grand,
To vanquish the enemy, our blood shall water the land.

With every beat of the drum, our spirits soar high,
""One, two, one, two,"" our marching rhythm does cry.
For our nation's honor, we go forth with might,
The drums of war thunder, guiding us through the fight.

Today, the battlefield awaits, our valor put to the test,
With hearts unwavering and brave, we'll stand among the best.
Embrace death, for heaven awaits, or live with glory untold,
Let the cymbals clash and the tales of our bravery unfold.

Life and limb we offer, at this crucial hour,
With every steady step, we feel our inner power.
We leave behind our homes, our loved ones dear,
For our nation's cause, we conquer every fear.

Like a storm we surge forth, destined to shine bright,
With the divine as our guide, we fear not day or night.
For our nation, we live or die, our love knows no bounds,
March forward, climb every peak, let victory resound.

Glory and honor await, listen to the drums' call,
Those who cower in fear, like jackals, they shall fall.
We leave behind our homes, our loved ones we hold dear,
With hearts ablaze, we march on, banishing every fear.

Our mortal bodies may perish, turn to dust and then fade,
But for our nation's honor, our spirits will never degrade.
Brave warriors, united, in rows so long and bold,
March forth with unwavering steps, let our story be told.

With eyes fixed on the prize, our hearts filled with burning might,
The drums of war thunder, guiding us through the night.
Today, we settle old scores, with courage we stand tall,
Our weapons raised high, ready to answer freedom's call.

Awaken, Kali, awaken! Let your power ignite,
For our nation's defense, we fight with all our might.
With every beat of the drum, we march in perfect line,
The enemy's reign will crumble, as our spirits intertwine.

Life itself is a battle, our eyes gleam with fire,
Our bodies may turn to dust, but our souls will inspire.
Look around, sons of Nepal, let our spirits ignite,
Vanquish the enemy, ascend to victory's height.

With every step, be cautious, let your resolve never sway,
Brave warriors, be steadfast, like stars that light the way.
For our nation's call, we depart, leaving loved ones behind,
The drums of war thunder, a rhythm we hold enshrined.```

सौन्दर्य-उपासना,"```
(1) I yearn to see all things beautiful,
To fill my heart and mind with their grace.
My eyes, they thirst for beauty's view,
In such delight, I find my place.

(2) From radiant blooms, a fragrant delight,
A subtle pleasure fills my soul.
My heart overflows with pure delight,
A feeling words can't quite console.

(3) I drink the sweetness of the blue sky's dome,
Where stars like playful diamonds gleam.
The moon's sweet nectar, I make my own,
My eyes, two cups, catch every beam.

(4) The azure bowl of the vast expanse,
Pours down its essence, pure and bright.
Is that a light that here does dance?
Or heaven's nectar, shining light?

(5) This world, so beautiful, a wondrous sight,
With stars like jewels, a dazzling array.
No words can capture their brilliant light,
Like flowers strung, they light the way.

(6) The maker of this world, so vast and grand,
Must possess beauty beyond compare.
How wondrous is this creation planned,
What treasures in its heart we share.

(7) My eyes well up with tears that flow,
A tremor runs through flesh and bone.
As I draw near, in meditation's glow,
The true form of all things is shown.

(8) All things unpleasant, dark, and unkind,
They sting my heart, a painful dart.
But those that shine, with beauty aligned,
Bring lasting joy to my weary heart.

(9) Witnessing this world, so strange and bright,
A thought within my mind takes hold.
To craft such beauty, a radiant light,
And leave behind a tale to be told.
```"
फूल-परी,"```
My garden is full of colorful, playful fairies,
Oh, how beautiful they are, whispering and giggling.
Adorned with shimmering clothes,
Fragrant with sweet perfumes,
Soft and colorful like silk.

In the green canopy, the wind dances,
Swaying and swirling, it never rests.
Adorned with sparkling diamond dew,
They smile and beckon me with their eyes,
Sharing their joy with me.

Beautiful birds with soft, colorful feathers,
Flutter around them,
Their playful dance is so mesmerizing,
It's almost scary to touch.
They speak to me from above,
""Where do you come from, little girl, a forest fairy?""

Blushing, they reply,
""Where colorful, soft clouds hang low,
Where tall rainbows bloom in many hues.""

""What is that world like, shimmering with colors?
Do you have wings, beautiful and bright?""

""Where were you born, little ones?""
""We were born from the dreams of God's heart,
In the shimmering light of dawn.""

""Do you dance silently, like colorful birds?""
""We speak with kind hearts,
And when we receive His command,
We open our hearts and dance,
Always smiling, for you, our Lord, have enchanted the world.""

Our hearts are woven with thousands of languages,
Adorned with the love of the world, like a precious jewel.
Made of earth, yet filled with heavenly nectar,
Small and beautiful, fragrant and full of emotion.

Let's illuminate this world with beautiful colors,
Spreading fragrance and happiness in the air.
Removing everyone's pain,
We, your children, are drawn to you, our Lord.

We spread our fragrance, captivating the world,
Sharing the sweet honey of our hearts.
May life be like a dream, a beautiful moment,
May the world be filled with joy and sweetness.

""Give us soft jewels and vibrant colors,""
""Make it happen,"" they say, with joyful hearts.
Our hearts are overflowing with nectar, ready to nourish others,
That's why our fragrance spreads everywhere.

How beautiful, look, the book-bird,
This poor thing spreads its two wings.
How many drops it opens, shimmering,
And I, engrossed, watch, ah!

How many layers, look, in its nest,
How many feathers it spreads, how delightful!
The more I look, the farther it flies,
I ride on it, always in bliss.

Sometimes I reach the palaces of clouds,
All gold, how real!
Among which, in the worlds of stories,
I contemplate new things.

Sometimes I go abroad, somewhere,
Amazed to see the pictures,
In Patna, Benares, Bombay,
I wander, immersed in colors.

Sometimes, crossing many oceans,
I wander in London, look, my friend!
Riding so many motors, so many trams,
Flying in airplanes.

I converse with so many,
With those from long ago, as much as I do,
My mouth only oozes with nectar,
Taking rhythm, sweetness, and happiness.

The palaces of yore,
The shining swords,
Glittering, I see them,
History turned into stories and poems.

Sometimes I see new scenes,
Sometimes the world of joy and sorrow,
I converse with bygone eras,
How fun it is to ride the book-bird.
```"
धूलो,"```
This is the dust of my homeland,
I will become water and mingle with it.
Pouring down as heavy rain,
I will shower this land.

May this feeling of belonging never fade,
I am a fragrant particle.
Behind me, flowers will bloom,
And thousands will inhale their sweet perfume.
```"
नेपाली सलाई बट्टा,"```
Where the shimmering rays adorn,
A radiant face, intensely red, like a rose,
The sun, a vibrant poem,
Unveiling colors, bright and bold.

May a new flame ignite within the heart,
As darkness fades, and lamps burn bright,
Why does the sun's ray shine so strong?
A new era dawns, with newfound light.

Who am I? Who am I? In the forest, who makes that cuckoo sound? Oh!
No, no, it's not me, it's not me, but who is it? Who is it that remains unknown?

Is it in the flower? Or hidden in the branches?
Is it in the fragrance? Or does it reside in the birds?
Towards the bud? Or within a single bud?
It feels like a dream, a fleeting vision.

Who am I? Who am I? I fail to recognize,
This shimmering essence, carrying a myriad of hues.
Tell me, who is hiding, making spring bloom?
This question, so delightful, captivates me.

Who am I? Who am I? Asks everything,
With a childlike heart, a flowing stream of delight.
Who creates this colorful spring,
With new and wondrous creations?

तस्वीर,"```
(1) Tell me, tell me, little one, how did you get ready?
How delightful and beautiful, what fun! May I have a taste?
With such skill, you've perfected every face,
What a clever thing, this essence of a picture you embrace.

(2) The mouth is perfect, the nose so slender and fine,
And look, the clothes fit just right, how divine!
Anger, joy, all emotions are captured with such grace,
Every day I watch you, finding joy and solace.

(3) Who could have painted all these people so well,
With such artistry and skill, I can't tell!
With a heart full of color and imaginative flair,
How many worlds could be created, beyond compare?

(4) The more I look, the more real it seems to be,
Every face speaks, none appear incomplete to me.
For a moment, I enter this world I find,
Where my whims and fancies are always aligned.

(5) As I gaze upon it, listening intently,
My mind wanders, lost in contemplation plenty.
The mouths all speak, the essence of the picture unfolds,
Trees bloom, and thousands of wings take hold.

(6) Come, my friend, let's climb a branch and see,
From above, let's observe this imagery.
Every day I study it, just like this,
Immersed in the worlds within each artistic bliss. 
```"
हैँसा बुढीको मुख,"```
(1) Look, a face devoid of joy and laughter,
Covered in wrinkles, countless in number.
Like deep ravines etched with sorrow,
Reflecting a life of hardship and slumber.

(2) No color graces the lips, nor strength in the hand,
Only a stick to lean on, a pitiful stand.
Half her body seems to have withered away,
Leaving behind a frail shell, in disarray.

(3) Her bent back bears the weight of time's embrace,
Hair turned silver, a frosty, white trace.
Eyes once bright, now dimmed and forlorn,
No longer keen to see the world reborn.

(4) Flies buzz around her, a constant refrain,
As she sits motionless, her spirit in pain.
A courtyard lies empty, a mockery of cheer,
While she yearns for comfort, her end drawing near.

(5) Neither a celestial being nor a haunting sprite,
Just an old woman, her life's journey taking flight.
Reduced to dust, she begs with a trembling plea,
""Give me some tobacco,"" a desperate decree.

(6) Witnessing her plight, a chuckle escapes my lips,
But then I pause, a wave of realization grips.
Where are her teeth, lost to the passage of time?
And why adorn her hair with frost, a cruel mime?

(7) Wrinkles stretch across her throat, a thirsty terrain,
As she drinks water with effort, enduring the strain.
Ears grow deaf, yet she clings to life's fading light,
Turning towards the sound of water, day and night.

(8) Her lips move in a silent, whispered hum,
An old woman, like a tree stripped bare, overcome.
Does she mutter spells, seeking solace and might?
Or ward off evil spirits in the fading light?

(9) No, no, don't tease her, let her be,
For fear grips her heart, if tears you should see.
She hides her pain behind a wrinkled facade,
This pitiful soul, burdened and dismayed.

(10) Once a vibrant soul, full of life's sweet song,
Now a frail echo, where did it all go wrong?
Life's journey ends, leaving emptiness in its wake,
Enough with mockery, for compassion's sake.

"
गाउँ दिने कथा,"```
Riding a howdah on a horse,
An elephant atop the howdah,
The playful king,
Faced such a plight!

Two huts, dark and small,
Two stars twinkling above,
Branches up high, bushes down low,
My dear, what could that be?
``` 
"
पृथ्वी-भकुण्डो,"```
(1) The round earth, a wobbly pumpkin, spinning day by day, kicking and tumbling every moment. Always thrown to the east, the day runs to the west, who plays with this pumpkin, which day will it stop, which Hari?

(2) There's a vast field, the biggest of all, shimmering blue, always lit, laughing in many ways. It throws itself alone, tumbling and turning day and night, have you seen anyone playing football on that side?
```"
जुनी,"```
(1)A life of stealing and troubling is like a fly,
A life of decorating the mind is like a deer.
The lazy and sleepy one is called a python,
Be careful, or your next life will be bad.

(2)“I will be big,” says the one who will be an elephant,
The one who kicks and tramples will be a horse.
The one who drinks blood will be a mosquito,
So be careful, I leave your next life to you.

(3)Dirty thoughts make you a vulture,
The one who doesn't donate in this world is a donkey, they say.
""Even a stone-hearted person can change,"" he said,
""Change your ways,"" he listened with his ears.
```"
झाँगघर,"```
(1) Let's build a home together,
Though the world be our Earth, let it be heaven.
May our hearts bloom like flowers, filled with joy,
And our thoughts flow like gentle waves.

(2) The waves' home is a new one,
Within it lies a different world altogether.
The soul, like a bird, is caged there,
Yet it speaks such sweet and novel words.

(3) So many windows adorn this abode,
Sunlight streams in, waves of happiness abound.
Eagerly entering every corner,
A cool breeze refreshes the eyes.
